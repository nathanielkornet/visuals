this is just a place for me to take notes as I work through this.

As of now it seems that I can only have one `renderToScreen` effect active at a time. Otherwise the screen goes blank. There may be a way around this, but it's not clear to me yet.

THINGS TO TRY:

- Maybe give each `renderToScreen` thing its own effect composer?
